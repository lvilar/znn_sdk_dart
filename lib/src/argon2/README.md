# Argon2 package

Argon2 package implements FFI (Foreign Function Interface) wrappers for native C code in order to improve performance.

These wrappers are used by Dart's `package:argon2_ffi_base` package.

At the moment Zenon Dart SDK only supports statically built libraries which are provided with this SDK in the `blobs/`
subfolder.
